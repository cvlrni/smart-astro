This folder contains Julia code developed to propagate both the full coupled orbital-attitude dynamics and
the averaged coupled orbital-attitude dynamics. 

Here, you can find two folders: 
- ATTITUDE: this is the Julia package with all the functions for the coupled orbital-attitude dynamics propagation
- workspace : this is a folder with examples for the employment of ATTITUDE

For further details, look at the documentation contained in the ATTITUDE package. 

The theory behind the code is summarised in the two following papers: 
- I. Cavallari, J. Feng, S. Bi, and M. Vasile. Semi-Analytical Attitude Propagation for Earth Orbiting Objects. 2024.
- I. Cavallari, J. Feng, S. Bi, and M. Vasile. Semi-analytical attitude propagation of low-altitude Earth orbiting objects. 2024.
